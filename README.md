## Coding Style Guide

### Coding standards, best practices and developer guidelines

The intent of this guide is to reduce cognitive friction when scanning code from different authors. It does so by enumerating a shared set of rules and expectations about how to format PHP code. Ideally, all code should appear as if written by one person.

It helps to have one set of guidelines to be used among all projects. Thus, the benefit of this guide is not in the rules themselves, but in the sharing of those rules.

The style rules herein are derived from the PHP Framework Interop Group [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/). By-and-large they are the same but they are _PHP Standards Recommendations_ and, as such, have been amended in several places for pragmatic and practical purposes. PSR  Please be professional and leave dogma at the door.

Rules have been written for [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) and are available in the Sniffs repository.

For brevity, the term “class” refers to all classes, interfaces, and traits throughout.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in these documents are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).
